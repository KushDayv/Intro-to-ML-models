### sample-ML-model

*** This is a model that I created when doing an introduction to ML

-> This is the work flow:

 1.Importing the raw data set from a git hub repo, and printing it out to see how it appears. 

2. Splitting the data set into the X and Y ,,,to rep the axis.

3. Splitting the data to have data that will be used to train the model and the data that will be used to test the trained model

  -> The training data is 80% of the total and then use the remaining 20% to 
      test the model. 

4. The first Algorithm that is Linear Regression.

    -> Training the model
   
    -> Applying the model to make the predictions.
   
    -> Evaluating the performance of the model


5. The second Algorithm used is Random Forest (Regressor)

     -> Traning the model

     -> Model performance evaluation.

6. A comparison of the two models.

7. Representing the output using scatter points.
